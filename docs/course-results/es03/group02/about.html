            <h1>ABOUT </h1>
            <h2>THE PROJECT </h2>
            <p>I SEE U is a project developed during the Final Synthesis Laboratory in <i><b>Density Lab</i></b> at the <i><b>Politecnico di Milano</i></b>.</p>
            <p>This project is an extension of <a href="https://densitydesign.github.io/teaching-dd15/course-results/es02/group02/" target="_blank">protocol 3 from phase II</a>, which highlighted what’s being captured by the most recent cameras on a
              website called Insecam. During that phase we collected videos from different countries to show the variety between them and the relevance of the content.</p>
            <p>I SEE U showcases six different stories of leaked security camera footage found on Insecam, each from a different country. It takes the audience through an informative and interactive journey during which the exact location of the
              camera is tracked and name and contact details of the place being capture are retrieved. It further provides an opportunity to the audience to contact the camera owner and inform them that their privacy is at risk. The journey ends
              with a guide that presents a set of tips to make a safer use of security cameras.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="col-ld-offset- col-md-6">

            <h2>AIM, FOCUS AND OBJECTIVE </h2>
            <p>The aim of this project is to inform the audience, with simple language and real content, that leaked security camera feeds can be easily tracked using simple online tools in just a few clicks.</p>
            <p>The project is centered on the use of security cameras and the possible negative consequences of their use. It focuses on a specific audience: existing or potential owners of security cameras and people who are directly or indirectly
              under camera vigilance.</p>
            <p>The main objective of the project is to reflect the vulnerability of cameras that is often more pervasive than expected. People use cameras to feel safe, but paradoxically end up putting their privacy and security at risk. With this
              project we want to inform, warn and provoke a direct response in the audience.</p>
            <h2>MESSAGE </h2>
            <p>Surveillance cameras are becoming part of our daily lives all around the world. How would you feel if you knew that someone can watch you in another country and discover where you live or work? Showing unauthorized access to these
              videos, the direct message is the vulnerability of these cameras and the ignorance of their possible misuse. How can a security device invert the roles of security and become a window to the personal world?</p>

            <h2><br><br>THE PROCESS AND TOOLS USED</h2>
            <p>The entire research and execution process has been carried out manually. We picked six camera streams from different countries and locations such as a bar in Italy, a motorcycle shop in France, a fast-food restaurant in the USA, or a
              convenience store in Brasil. We created a video for each one to document the process of tracking these cameras.</p>
            <p>First, we observed the cameras, analysing them and looking at specific details that led us to find the location.</p>
            <br><img src="images/imgvideos.png" style="width:70%;height:70%;">
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-offset- col-md-6">
            <p><br><br><br><br>We used platforms like <b> Google Search, Google Maps, TripAdvisor, Facebook and others </b>to obtain supporting evidence of each location and to further re-check the correct address. Through the exact location or name
              of the place, it becomes very easy to obtain their contact information online.</p>
            <p>With a single search it was possible to obtain all the data of the place, including opening hours, telephone and also pictures, that often helped or allowed us to confirm the location.</p>

            <p><br><br>After obtaining the phone number, we decided to call them to confirm the camera location and to inform that there was open access to the camera. As different countries were chosen, the calls were made in the local language of
              each location, with added English subtitles in the videos. It is interesting to note the different kind of responses and reactions that people have to the situation.</p>

            <br><img class="rectangle2" src="images/call.gif" style="width:80%;height:80%;">
            <p>Some are shocked or frightened whereas some think this is a prank and hang up the call. These reactions resonate with the fact that the people were unaware of this situation and that it therefore requires urgent attention.</p>

            <p>Changes were made on the audio of the calls to protect the anonymity of the person in cause. At the end of each process video, there is an explanation of the main reactions during and/or after the phone call and a feedback, a week or
              longer after, disclaiming if the camera was or not still open to access.</p>

            <h2>INTERACTIONS </h2>
            <p>In the main page, it’s possible to choose between the six different camera stories and decide with which story to begin. Moreover, when the story is finished, it’s possible to go back and watch the other ones. </p>
            <p>At various steps the audience is given the possibility to either keep going deeper in the data breach or to opt out. The idea is to actively involve and engage the audience while transmitting the idea of doing something that is "not
              allowed" due to its disrespect to other's privacy. This rhetoric of breaching others privacy enforces the message yet in a cautionary way.</p>

            <p>After the last video of the research process, we present to the reader the possibility to call to the camera's owner. By making the audience feel that they will be able to contact the camera owners, we present a set of suggestions on
              how to proceed in this kind of situations during the call.</p>

            <p><br><br>This step is an attempt to make the audience feel more engaged with the project, suggesting even the possibility to call to another cameras owners to warn about the breach. It is followed by suggestions to make sure that the
              audience convey the message to the security camera owner in the best way possible, preparing the readers to spread awareness regarding to security cameras vulnerability. By doing this the message is reached and absorbed by both, the
              audience and the camera owner.</p>

            <br><img class="rectangle2" src="images/beforecall.gif" style="width:70%;height:70%;">
            <p>At the end, we present our last video, that provides a phone call made by us to the respective owner or employee of the establishment where the leaked camera was present. The edit of the call was made due to privacy reasons.</p>
